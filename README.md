# AiSL
Models for text to ASL and back built for CatapultHacks, where we won Best Social Impact Prize. My contribution was building these two models.

# Text-to-ASL and ASL-to-Text Pipeline  

This repository contains the implementation of a dual pipeline system that bridges the gap between text and American Sign Language (ASL). The project features two key models:  
1. **Text-to-ASL Generative Image Model** (using a Variational Autoencoder).  
2. **ASL-to-Text Classification Pipeline** (fine-tuned ResNet-based classifier).

## ðŸš€ Features  

- **Text-to-ASL Generator**:  
  - Generates realistic ASL hand gesture images from text inputs.  
  - Built using a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) with an enhanced two-stage learning process:  
    1. **Representation Learning**: Learns latent representations of ASL hand gesture images.  
    2. **Conditional Embedding**: Embeds text labels into the encoder, producing embeddings that guide the decoding process to generate the appropriate ASL gestures.  

- **ASL-to-Text Classifier**:  
  - Converts ASL images back into text using a fine-tuned ResNet.  
  - Optimized for high accuracy and robust classification even in noisy or occluded scenarios.

## ðŸ’¡ Future Work
-  Enhance the VAE with larger datasets and GAN-based refinement for more realistic images.
-  Expand to word based representations instead of letter
